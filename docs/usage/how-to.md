# How to create a slide

Each slide is defined with a `## `.

The first slide doesn't need to be defined, only if you want to add class.

Example:

```md
## .[cover]

# The Title of my talk

## The title for the new slide
```

In your slide, you can write in Markdown or HTML.

So, you can add Svelte, Vue, React, Preact, ... as you want ;)

In the [syntax section](/syntax) of this documentation you can see how to internationalise, use images, comments, ... your slides
